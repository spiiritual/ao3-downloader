      <p>like a month ago when i was reading the manga, the second i saw the word “bltv,” i started writing this fic. and then ch241 came out and i started foaming at the mouth, and then reworked this entire fic in a haze of kiis hype lmao. which i’m sure will keep happening as we get kis backstory. anywho, this fic is finally here</p><p>a lil psa; this entire story comes directly from my imagination. any mentions of usernames, handles, fics, posts, etc are not (!!) allusions to anyone/anything in real life. the way i portray and interpret the in-canon bltv fandom is not a one to one of irl, so that will be pretty different in a lot of regards. i will make references to other languages to account for the internationality of the bltv fandom, but this fic itself will be completely in english. this fanfic is meant to be pure fun and shenanigans lol</p><p>other random notes; this fic is post-blue lock and all the characters are in their early/mid twenties. for simplicity's sake, everyone is basically playing for the same team they did during the nel just now professionally. this fic will be a longfic; just how long idk yet</p><p>this fic is truly a comedy of errors. filled with wacky zany fanficy nonsense. and if anyone has any suggestions on tropes they’d like to see within the fics, feel free to let me know! can’t guarantee anything, but i’ll consider it</p><p>with all that being said!! i hope you enjoy reading this fic as much as i enjoy writing it :&gt;</p><p>-jury</p>

  <i>“Shut it!”</i>
</p><p>At this point, Hiori and Raichi’s cackling bordered on screaming, and Isagi felt embarrassment crawl up his spine as patrons of the restaurant they were eating dinner in sent them wayward looks.</p><p>“It was so funny! You both were practically at each other’s throats,” Raichi exclaimed between wheezing breaths.</p><p>Yukimiya nodded quickly, a wide grin on his face. “And the way you reacted at the idea of even working together with Kaiser! You were almost as feral as you are on the field.”</p><p>Hiori was laughing too hard to speak.</p><p>It had been a wonderful day -- keyword being <i>had.</i></p><p>Isagi had grown fond of the warm summers in Munich for the past few years, the gentle heat that came with blooming trees and windswept skies, and the nighttime rain that cooled the air afterwards. It was perfect for the day they’d received off from their coach, Noel Noa. Isagi got to sleep in, take his time making lunch, and go on a nice, long walk afterwards. He video chatted with some of his friends, catching up with how they were doing on their respective teams.</p><p>And he was able to get dinner with some of his teammates.</p><p>Which had turned out to be a mistake.</p><p>He wasn’t sure quite how the conversation started, but talking with former Blue Lock players often led to reminiscing about their time in the program. It was nice, entertaining even. Until Hiori brought up his relationship with Michael Kaiser.</p><p>And then it was all downhill from there.</p><p>“You were such a tsundere~” Raichi grinned, tears forming in the corner of his eyes. “You used to have an aneurysm every time we told you KaiSagi was trending again like you didn’t secretly love it.”</p><p>“I will end you.”</p><p>“And I can see you’re still a tsundere~”</p><p>Another bout of laughter.</p><p>Gagamaru patted him gently. “At least you two don’t want to kill each other anymore… I think.”</p><p>And that was, in fact, true. Considering the start of their relationship was trying to destroy each other, the only way to go from there was up. As much as Isagi despised it at the time, they did end up producing a chemical reaction and working together -- to the delight of their fans. And since then, their relationship had improved marginally. And that was Isagi trying to be generous.</p><p>There wasn’t anyone who infuriated him as much as Kaiser. With his condescending smirk, flirtatious remarks, and arrogant attitude, it shocked Isagi himself that they weren’t getting into fist fights every day. But both of them had mellowed out <i>just a little bit</i> off the field, and on the field, they actually worked well together. Kaiser was a genius and Isagi admired him as a soccer player, and the moments they were able to sync up ended up being some of the most memorable parts of his career.</p><p>Isagi did end up coming to Germany, which unfortunately, stroked Kaiser’s already massive ego.</p><p>He didn’t come for Kaiser, obviously. Bastard München was an incredible team to play for. Kaiser just happened to be there.</p><p>Which meant that he got to deal with his atrocious personality.</p><p>There were rare moments where he and Kaiser were able to sit in companionable silence, but most of the time, their tentative friendship consisted of them snarking at one another.</p><p>“You’re all assholes,” Isagi muttered, his glare meeting everyone’s delighted grins. “Why are we even talking about this anyway?”</p><p>Hiori shrugged. “One of those old Blue Lock TV clips of you and Kaiser went viral again for some reason. I just happened to watch it.”</p><p>“Oh, was it the chin grab?” Yukimiya asked.</p><p>“No, it was when Isagi fainted after the Manshine City match,” Kunigami cut into the conversation.</p><p>Isagi groaned. “Fuck. Not you too.”</p><p>He should just leave the restaurant. He should leave them with the bill and walk away. Why was that clip going viral <i>again?</i> It was so fucking embarrasing watching Kaiser carry him off the field. Isagi resisted the urge to slam his head against the table.</p><p>“Oh, yeah! And the Twitter reactions for this one are still pure gold too. It’s almost as wild as the storm our game a few months ago caused where you and Kaiser assisted each other,” Hiori responded gleefully as he pulled out his phone. “Let me read some aloud for you, Isagi!”</p><p>“Kurona! Back me up here,” Isagi pleaded at his friend.</p><p>Kurona, who’d been sitting quietly this entire time, attempting to blend into the shadows, blinked. “Uh, I watched the clip. The clip.”</p><p>“Kurona!”</p><p>The absolute betrayal.</p><p>“Y’know, you should take the time to actually check out some of these clips,” Raichi suggested, an annoyingly knowing look on his face. “And not the technical ones you review in the screening rooms, the Blue Lock TV ones. You might learn something.”</p><p>Hiori giggled as he sent him a sly smile. “Yeah, Isagi, you should check out <i>the best couple of the league~”</i></p><p>Fuck his life.</p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center><p>When Isagi Yoichi looked back on this moment, he would blame the fact that it was late at night, his mind wandering towards sleep and morbid curiosity. And he would blame Raichi and Hiori.</p><p>
  <i>“You might learn something.”</i>
</p><p>What could Isagi possibly learn from watching a bunch of old BLTV clips? A reminder of how much he and Kaiser hated each other back then?</p><p>Night had settled into the sky hours ago, moonlight fluttering into his bedroom through the half-drawn curtain. He was watching a compilation video of Noel Noa’s best plays on YouTube.</p><p>Right at the top of his recommendations was the clip of him and Kaiser that was, yet again, going viral. He glanced at the view count and tried not to gawk. <i>Over twenty-four million views.</i></p><p>It sounded strange to admit, but more often than not, Isagi honestly forgot that he was famous.</p><p>He had just always been so focused on soccer -- because soccer was amazing and took priority, always -- that most other things simply fell to the wayside. Unlike his friends who often hosted watch parties, he had never bothered watching Blue Lock TV. Isagi had social media in a professional capacity, but he rarely used it unless management asked him to repost or like something. Any information from social media was given to him secondhand -- and against his will -- by Hiori, Yukimiya, and Raichi, and because they loved tormenting him, he usually tried to tune them out.</p><p>Sometimes people would recognize him or a fan would approach him and it’d be startling until he remembered, <i>‘Oh, wait, yeah. I’m famous.’</i></p><p>Isagi, clearly not thinking straight, decided to click on the video. And yeah, falling into the arms of Michael Kaiser was as embarrassing as he remembered. Thanks for nothing, Raichi!</p><p>To get away from the video, he started scrolling through the comments.</p><p><b>@dynamo90</b> 6 years ago</p><p>lmao next game he should get bridal carried</p><p>

</p><p>Isagi paused the clip -- because <i>fuck that video</i> -- and glanced at the last comment again. He was familiar with the term ‘KaiSagi.’ It was impossible not to be with a demented friend like Hiori. And he had heard the term randomly throughout his career, usually to refer to him and Kaiser as a duo on the field -- or as a couple.</p><p>Thanks for the reminders, Hiori.</p><p>Sometimes, tabloid and gossip magazine reporters would ask him about his “relationship” with Kaiser and they’d use the term. Or a fan would ask for something signed with him and Kaiser on it and mention it.</p><p>Isagi knew back when Blue Lock TV was airing, during the events of the Neo Egoist League, following their partnership was <i>really popular.</i> His roommates kept him up to date on how everyone was glued to the edge of their seat, waiting to see if he and Kaiser would work together or do, uh, other stuff. But the Neo Egoist League and the U-20 World Cup left him so busy and he never checked his social media to begin with, he never really noticed it unless someone said something.</p><p>Kaiser himself had never brought up the term ‘KaiSagi’ with him. He probably had no idea it existed.</p><p>That lucky bastard.</p><p>Isagi remembered with horror when his roommates in the German stratum had taped KaiSagi art all over their room.</p><p>To this day, he still wasn’t sure where they got the printer.</p><p>Isagi didn't know what ‘fanfic’ meant though. He had never seen the term before.</p><p>He remembered a while back, Chigiri was telling him about how some fans enjoyed studying their games, writing long analysis posts about their plays and how their skills could be improved. Chigiri said he’d personally found some of them helpful. Maybe this was what Chigiri had been talking about?</p><p>Well, Isagi already bit the bullet and started teaming up with Kaiser. Maybe he could use this to figure out ways to improve their joined play styles.</p><p>And with that thought, he clicked the link.</p><blockquote>

    <b>Summary:</b>
  </p>
  <p>Kaiser returns to Germany. Isagi stays in Japan. And how that determines the rest of their lives.</p>
</blockquote><p>Isagi paused. He honestly wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at.</p><p>Was AO3 some sort of archive for analysis posts? Was their relationship a reference to them as partners on the field? Why was the title so long?</p><p>What the fuck was smut?</p><p>The summary didn’t make much sense either. If they were in different countries, they couldn’t play as a duo.</p><p>In a moment Isagi would later come to regret -- probably --, he continued reading.</p><blockquote>
  <p>There are moments in a person’s life when they’re standing at the precipice of change, preparing to leap into something they can never come back from. Moments of doing something for the first time. Or the last.</p>
  <p>Small moments that end up becoming so significant, nothing would be the same without them.</p>
  <p>They just don’t know it at the time.</p>
  <p>Michael’s moment is when he sees Yoichi for the first time, his figure running across the small screen of his phone.</p>
  <p>His next moment comes right before he leaves Japan.</p>
</blockquote><p>Yeah… this definitely was not an analysis post.</p><p>Isagi didn’t know what to make of it. Was this meant to be some wacky, flowery biography about Kaiser’s life or something? If so, why did so many people bother reading it?</p><p>Hm, if Isagi thought about it, Kaiser did seem to have the most rabid fans. Maybe the statistics checked out.</p><p>Well, he wasn’t going to read over two hundred thousand words. Especially so late at night. Who would ever do that?</p><p>If he wanted to figure out what was going on, he had to go right to the source. And with that, he clicked the tag: Isagi Yoichi/Michael Kaiser.</p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>What the fuck?! Why were there so many of whatever these ‘fanfics’ were? Isagi didn’t think his life was cool enough to warrant that many works. The Blue Lock project was incredible and it had been monumental for Japanese soccer, but that still seemed like a lot.</p><p>And now that Isagi thought about it, he didn’t really know much about Kaiser’s life or past. But that also meant whoever was writing these didn’t either, so what gave?</p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>What. The. Fuck.</p><p>What the fuck!?</p><p>On instinct, Isagi threw his phone across the room.</p><p>What did he just read? What was all that? Just… what the fuck?!</p><p>With that burst of adrenaline flowing through his veins, Isagi was now fully awake. AO3 was definitely not about meta analysis posts or biographies or anything remotely similar to that. It looked like it was about putting him and Kaiser in make-believe romantic and sexual scenarios.</p><p>Which… why? Who would ever want to date Michael Kaiser?</p><p>That sounded like torture!</p><p>And there were so many different kinds of stories. He still didn’t understand half the terms he saw, but at this point, did he want to know?</p><p>It might be better to just leave his phone there, never to pick it up again. He could simply remove this night from his memory and pretend he had no idea what Archive of Our Own was.</p><p>Isagi knew some people wanted him and Kaiser to be in a romantic relationship -- or they were convinced he already was -- though he didn’t realize it was <i>this</i> many people.</p><p>As much as he hated it at the time, the desire to see him and Kaiser working together and syncing up on the field made sense. It was a clear path forward for them to become an unstoppable duo. But Isagi didn’t really understand the ‘best couple of the league’ aspect his teammates were constantly teasing him with.</p><p>During the Neo Egoist League, they hated each other, wanted to devour each other and bring one another to ruin. And now at Bastard München, they just barely got along with each other. Why were so many people so invested in their relationship?</p><p>The longer Isagi sat on his bed contemplating that question, the more it bugged him.</p><p>Why? Just… why?</p><p>And the more time passed, the more the temptation to pick up his phone grew. Maybe if he figured out what was up with these fanfics, he could understand the reasoning for why people wanted them together to begin with.</p><p>And then figure out a way to end it. Yeah. Solid plan. Brilliant even.</p><p>What Hiori, Raichi, and Yukimiya didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them.</p><p>With that in mind, Isagi slowly approached his phone as if it were a newborn fawn. He picked it up with caution before returning to the comfort of his bed. He would just check out a completely normal, not insane story. One that was nice and short and had tags that he understood.</p><p>At the end of the first page, Isagi found a fanfic that was only a few hundred words and already completed.</p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>The summary and tags seemed simple enough. Completely implausible, but at least he understood what everything was saying. With that, he clicked into the story.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Kaiser gently kissed the ring on Isagi’s left hand and whispered soft praises in his ear. “I love you more than anything, Isagi,” he hummed, his voice sensual. “More than soccer even.”</p>
  <p>Isagi blushed cutely and giggled.</p>
</blockquote><p>Absolutely no fucking way.</p><p>Isagi could not, in a million years, ever imagine Kaiser saying that he loved something more than soccer. In that way, Isagi and Kaiser were the same -- soccer was <i>everything.</i> And Kaiser would never say anything so… sweet. Isagi couldn’t even picture it. The idea was completely out of character for him.</p><p>Also he wasn’t <i>cute.</i> If Kaiser ever did something like that, he’d throw him off a balcony into shark infested waters.</p><p>And, he realized after a moment, it felt really strange to imagine Kaiser calling him anything other than <i>'Yoichi.'</i></p><p>If he was going to get any sense of understanding why people wanted them together, he needed to find a story that portrayed them accurately.</p><p>And thus, his search continued.</p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center><p>It was the warm beams of sunlight gliding through his window that finally ended up catching Isagi’s attention.</p><p>Sunlight…</p><p>Fuck! What time was it?</p><p>Isagi had caught the middle of sunrise, the sun peaking out halfway behind the horizon. He stared at the time on his clock with wide eyes, gaping in shock. He hadn’t even noticed it was getting so late -- or so early, at this point.</p><p>How many hours had he spent scrolling through AO3?! How had time passed that quickly?</p><p>Bastard München’s morning practice would start in two hours and he was running on no sleep.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Isagi Yoichi was so fucked.</p>
